            <p>
                Tabletop Aficionados is a site for people to search and review their 
                favorite boardgames. We already have a substantial database of boardgames
                within our site that is being updated constantly by the site's community.
                If there isn't a game a user can fin, however, anyone can create a listing
                of a boardgame and review for it. This site is a gathering of the casual
                or hardcore players of tabletop games. So feel free to explore the various
                boardgames on our site in order to plan for the next family gathering or night
                in!

                No form of inappropriate reviews as well as creation of fake or inaccurate
                tabletop games will be allowed for posting. Each review and tabletop listing
                will be reviewed by our admins before being allowed to be posted. In terms of
                being qualified to being a tabletop game on the site, it must have a retail
                price and a game actually sold to or released to the public in some shape or 
                form.
